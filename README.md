## what
Enter any text input (longer texts make it more interesting) and click the buttons.

You'll get the word tokens with their frequencies in descending order (cutoff <= 2).

I think the results look like a wordðŸŒ³. I like that. : )

## why
I'm learning NLP, and this was a little exercise using RegEx and JavaScript, while thinking about word frequencies.
